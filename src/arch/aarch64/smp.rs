//! Starting the secondary CPUs.
//!
//! The kernel starts on the boot CPU only. It expects every other CPU to
//! wait in the `smp_spin` callout, with the MMU on, until it posts the
//! address of its per-CPU start code in the system page (`smp.start_addr`).
//! Getting them there takes two steps, as in QNX's startup library:
//!
//! 1. *Start*: while startup builds the system page, the boot CPU releases
//!    each secondary CPU in turn (how is the board's business: on the
//!    Raspberry Pi, a spin table) and waits for it. The CPU moves to EL1,
//!    describes itself in cpuinfo, sets up its GIC interface, and waits.
//! 2. *Transfer*: once the system page is in place, the boot CPU lets the
//!    CPUs go one at a time. Each turns its MMU on, enters `smp_spin`, and
//!    clears `smp.pending`, which tells the boot CPU to let the next go.
//!
//! Until the boot CPU turns its own MMU on, it reads memory uncached;
//! `smp_spin` cleans the line it writes so that the boot CPU sees it.
