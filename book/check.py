"""Check that the book's code references match the source tree.

mdBook includes code with {{#include path:anchor}}, where the anchor is a
pair of comments in the source file:

    // ANCHOR: <name>
    ...
    // ANCHOR_END: <name>

mdBook itself does not fail when an anchor is missing: it silently
includes nothing. This script makes every reference a hard error instead:

- every {{#include}} names an existing file and an anchor that exists in
  it, with a matching ANCHOR_END and at least one line between them;
- includes by line number are rejected, since they drift with every edit;
- includes stay inside the book's own source tree (ROOT, below), so the
  book can move with it;
- every anchor in that tree is used by some chapter;
- every path written in a code span exists;
- every source file is listed in the source map;
- links to the other book point to one of its chapters.

The configuration is the constants below; the other book has a copy of
this script with its own.

Usage: python3 -I check.py   (exit status 1 on any error)
